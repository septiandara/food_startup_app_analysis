This report is prepared for a startup that sells food products, we are investigating user behaviour for the company's app. The report is focused on two aspeccts: event-based analytics and A/B testing.

We are studying the following:
1. The sales funnel: how many and which route did the users take to reach the purchase stage, and if a user did not continue to the purchase stage, which stage did they stuck in.
2. The results of an A/A/B test: whether the new design proposed by the UI/UX team, where the font for the entire app is changed, is shocking and intimidating. The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. Based on the results, we can find = out which set of fonts produces better results/purchases.
